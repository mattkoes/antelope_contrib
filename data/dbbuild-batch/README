This directory (contrib/data/dbbuild-batch) is intended to provide a
location for network operators to put dbbuild batch files representing
stations.  These files might be useful both as guides to constructing
batch files for other networks, and for creating master database
tables for data imported from external networks.

It's important to have some degree of organization at this level; the
first suggestion is to create a directory for each network.  Within
that directory, put individual dbbuild batch files for each station,
and add a README file with some information about the network and
people to contact.

If special parameter files and response files are needed to run
dbbuild with these files, they could be placed in the network
directory.  However, it would probably be better to add these files to
the main set, as follows:

    datalogger.pf   contrib/data/instruments/dataloggers/
    sensor.pf	    contrib/data/instruments/sensors/
    responses	    contrib/data/responses/ 

Each of these directories are further subdivided by manufacturer.

Participation and the level of detail in this area is entirely up to
the operators.  But some degree of cooperation might be helpful for
everyone.
