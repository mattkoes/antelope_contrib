.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbaler2db\fP is the first program in a series of programs to fill gapped data in a database.
\fBbaler2db\fP starts with data which has been recovered from a baler or other device in miniseed
format, make necessary corrections to the data, and builds a cleaned database of day volumes.  
All data recovered from a baler through a run of \fBbaler_admin\fP or send via cdrom 
(or equivalent) are assumed to be stored in miniseed files, all located in the directory 
\fImseed_dir\fP.  

The first step in \fBbaler2db\fP, after various checks, is to run \fBminiseed2days\fP which 
creates a new database named \fIraw_baler\fP in the same directory where \fImseed_dir\fP is located.
\fBminiseed2days\fP is executed with the \fI-C\fP option so that all miniseed blocketts which have 
problems such a "0" clock quality or corrupted miniseed data are removed.

Next, a new wfdisc named \fIdbout\fP is created using the same waveforms as \fIraw_baler\fP.  
The \fIdbout\fP wfdisc has any corrections provided through the \fIpffile\fP, fixing things like
known station or channel mislabling.  Any wfdisc records less than 2 seconds long are removed.

The \fIdbout\fP and \fIraw_baler\fP databases are linked to \fIdbmaster\fP through a descriptor 
file.   \fBdbfixchanids\fP  is run on \fIdbout\fP, followed by \fBdbfix_calib\fP and \fBdbverify\fP.

Finally if all is successful, a new row is added to the dbcentral database - \fIbalerdb_central\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
verbose
.IP "-d dbout"

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
\fBbaler2db\fP will only work on the directory \fImseed_dir\fP.   \fImseed_dir\fP can 
only contains miniseed files, no subdirectories.  It is good practice to execute \fBbaler2db\fP
in a different directory than where the miniseed files exist.
