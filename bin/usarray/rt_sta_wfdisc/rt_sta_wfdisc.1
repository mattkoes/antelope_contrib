.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the first in a series of 5 programs for processing baler 44 miniseed data.  The programs are
\fBrt_sta_wfdisc\fP, \fBrsync_baler\fP, \fBbaler_msd_proc\fP, \fBbaler_wf_proc\fP, and \fBbaler_active_to_dmc\fP.

\fBrt_sta_wfdisc\fP is designed make a wfdisc for miniseed data acquired through the rt system and organized 
in station-channel-day files for BH and LH seismic data and BD and LD infrasound/pressure data. All other SOH (state-of-health) 
channels as well as VH and UH seismic data are ignored.  

\fBrt_sta_wfdisc\fP can be operated in three modes.  In normal usage top command line is used.  In this 
mode the program opens the \fIdb.deployment\fP table to determine which stations need to be processed.
To process multiple stations simultaneously on multi-processor machines, \fBrt_sta_wfdisc\fP will fork 
itself for each station using the second or the third command line.  This is done because the Mac OSX requires a forked
process to be exec'ed internally to work properly.  This construction also works on other Unix platforms.
\fBThe second or third command lines are only used in debugging\fP.

\fBrt_sta_wfdisc\fP will limit itself to use only half the cores available up to 20 total with a minimum of 1. 

\fBrt_sta_wfdisc\fP creates a wfdisc row in the db \fIrt_sta_dir/sta/sta\fP.  The miniseed data
reside in the parent directory \fIwfbase\fP in files written as follows:
.IP 
[BL][HD] station-channel-day files are written in YYYY/DDD directories
.IP 

For each complete day of data, a gap list is calculated and stored in the db \fIrt_sta_dir/sta/sta\fP.
No gapes are filled by this program.  The assumption is that these data are used to fill any gaps in the 
baler data by later routines.

A dbdescriptor file is created for the db \fIrt_sta_dir/sta/sta\fP with pointers back to the appropriate
dbmaster. \fIchanid\fP and \fIcalibs\fP are set in the \fIrt_sta_dir/sta/sta.wfdisc\fP.  

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Verbose
.IP -V
Extremely verbose.  Used for debugging purposes only.
.IP -n
Test mode.  Does not execute commands.
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Name of parameter file to use.  $PFPATH is searched to find parameter file.
The default parameter file is \fBrt_sta_wfdisc\fP.
.IP "-m mail_to"
Email address list to send results.  Multiple email addresses should be comma delimited without
white space.
.IP "-f nforks"
Limit the number of forked processes.
.IP "-s sta_regex"
Regular expression of stations to process.
