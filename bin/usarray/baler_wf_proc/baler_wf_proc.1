.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the fourth in a series of 5 programs for processing baler 44 miniseed data.  The programs are
\fBrt_sta_wfdisc\fP, \fBrsync_baler\fP, \fBbaler_msd_proc\fP, \fBbaler_wf_proc\fP, and \fBbaler_active_to_dmc\fP.

\fBbaler_wf_proc\fP is designed make a wfdisc for miniseed data organized 
in station-channel-day files for BH and LH seismic data and BD and LD infrasound/pressure data. All other SOH (state-of-health) 
channels as well as VH and UH seismic data are station-channel-month files.  Only stations with 
real time data existing in \fIrt_sta_dir/sta/sta\fP will be processed.

\fBbaler_wf_proc\fP can be operated in three modes.  In normal usage top command line is used.  In this 
mode the program opens the \fIdb.deployment\fP table to determine which stations need to be processed.
To process multiple stations simultaneously on multi-processor machines, \fBbaler_wf_proc\fP will fork 
itself for each station using the second or the third command line.  This is done because the Mac OSX requires a forked
process to be exec'ed internally to work properly.  This construction also works on other Unix platforms.
\fBThe second or third command lines are only used in debugging\fP.

\fBbaler_wf_proc\fP will limit itself to use only half the cores available up to 20 total with a minimum of 1. 

\fBbaler_wf_proc\fP creates a wfdisc row in the db \fIarchivebase/sta/sta\fP.  The miniseed data
reside in the parent directory \fIarchivebase/sta\fP in files written as follows:
.IP 
1) [BL][HD] station-channel-day files are written in YYYY/DDD directories
.IP 
2) all other station-channels are written into YYYY/month_files/MM directories
.LP

Wfdisc rows for data in the YYYY/DDD directories are only written if:
.IP 
data for channels two days later exist.  The assumption being that all data are downloaded by then.
.LP

Wfdisc rows for data in the YYYY/month_files/MM directories are only written if:
.IP 
data for channels two months later exist.  The assumption being that all data are downloaded by then.
.LP

For each complete day of data, a gap list is calculated and stored in the db \fIarchivebase/sta/sta_baler\fP.
Any gaps which can be filled from the \fIrt_sta_dir/sta/sta\fP db, will be filled.  Then a final gap
list is calculated in the db \fIarchivebase/sta/sta_all\fP.

A dbdescriptor file is created for the db \fIarchivebase/sta/sta\fP with pointers back to the appropriate
dbmaster. \fIchanid\fP and \fIcalibs\fP are set in the \fIarchivebase/sta/sta.wfdisc\fP.  Checks are 
made to verify that a row in \fIarchivebase/sta/sta.schanloc\fP exists for every row in 
\fIarchivebase/sta/sta.wfdisc\fP with the exception of specifically excluded channels defined by \fIwfclean\fP
in the parameter file.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Verbose
.IP -V
Extremely verbose.  Used for debugging purposes only.
.IP -n
Test mode.  Does not execute commands.
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Name of parameter file to use.  $PFPATH is searched to find parameter file.
The default parameter file is \fBbaler_wf_proc\fP.

white space.
.IP "-f nforks"
Limit the number of forked processes.
.IP "-s sta_regex"
Regular expression of stations to process.
