.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbaler_request\fP is designed to generate a sync file of data gaps 
to be used by baler_admin to retrieve the missing data.  The sync file is 
written to file named \fIbaler_request_YYYY_MM\fP.  
.LP
The inputs to the program are the \fIgap_database\fP which contains gap table.  
There is an optional \fIdmc_gap_database\fP which contains a listing of gaps 
observed at the DMC.  If there is a \fIgap_database.deployment\fP table 
available, then all stations which have had their \fIequip_remove\fP field 
value set before the current date will be removed from the sync file.
