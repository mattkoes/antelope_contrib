.TH BALER_ACTIVE_TO_DMC 1 
.SH NAME
baler_active_to_dmc \- sends Baler 14 and Baler 44 miniseed dbs to DMC
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBbaler_active_to_dmc \fP  [-v] [-V] [-n] [-p \fIpf\fP] [-m \fImail_to\fP] [-c \fIorbclient\fP] [-s \fIsta_regex\fP] \fIdb\fP \fIorb\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the fifth in a series of 5 programs for processing baler 44 miniseed data.  The programs are
\fBrt_sta_wfdisc\fP, \fBrsync_baler\fP, \fBbaler_msd_proc\fP, \fBbaler_wf_proc\fP, and \fBbaler_active_to_dmc\fP.

\fBbaler_active_to_dmc\fP is designed to send unsent data to the DMC from balers with any possible 
gaps filled from the rt waveforms.  \fBobsip2orb\fP is used to send all data in the \fIbaler_active/sta/sta.wfdisc\fP
using \fIorb\fP.
\fBminiseed2orb\fP is used to send data to \fIorb\fP for the \fInon_wf_chan\fP channels. These channels reside in the same directories as the 
\fInon_wf_chan_proxy\fP channel.  Channels described by \fIwfclean\fP are not sent and are not expected
to have metadata.

Once a station is sent to the orb, and the DMC has drained that orb, then a sync file is created and sent to
the orb to signify the end of data transmission for that station.  Then the next station is processed.  
Sync files are stored in the \fIsync_dir\fP and are listed in the \fIdb.dmcfiles\fP table.

Once a station is closed and all data sent to the DMC, then the directory \fIbaler_active/sta\fP 
is moved to \fIbaler_final/sta\fP

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Verbose
.IP -V
Extremely verbose.  Used for debugging purposes only.
.IP -n
Test mode.  Does not execute commands.
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Name of parameter file to use.  $PFPATH is searched to find parameter file.
The default parameter file is \fBbaler_active_to_dmc\fP.
.IP "-m mail_to"
Email address list to send results.  Multiple email addresses should be comma delimited without
white space.
.IP "-c orbclient"
DMC orbclient to track.  Default is \fBorbmsd2days\fP.
.IP "-s sta_regex"
Regular expression of stations to process.
