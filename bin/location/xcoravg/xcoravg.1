.TH XCORAVG 1
.SH NAME
xcoravg - average redundant arrivals in dbxcor source array processing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
xcoravg db [-u -v -pf pffile]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program is a companion to the dbxcor (3) program when it is run
in source array processing mode.  Source array processing is an alternative
to cluster style cross correlation of local events.  Instead of correlating
all pairs dbxcor allows processing of ensembles of events from a common 
source region.  The groups, however, are rarely orthogonal so it is 
necessary to resolve duplicate arrival estimates when the
same seismogram is correlated with two groups of events.  This program
uses a simple averaging method.  This is not theoretically correct, but is
an approximation that will work reasonably well if groups do not
overlap too drastically.  The exact solution is a generalization of the
method commonly used for pairs of events to a form that is virtually 
identical to that used in seismic reflection processing in what is
called surface consistent static estimates.  I (GLP) have not yet implemented 
such a procedure, however, so for now this is the only way to resolve
redundant arrival estimates.  In fact, running this program is currently the
only way to transfer the output of dbxcor to the master arrival table. 
.LP
The program has only one required parameter of the database name db.  Note,
however, that the program will look for extension tables special to dbxcor
when run in source array processing mode.  
The main required table is one called xsaa 
(intended to be mnemonic for xcor source array analysis).  
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -u
This option is used to enable update mode. The default will do nothing and
run the program in a dry run mode.  The user is strongly urged to first
run the program in dry run mode looking carefully at the output for 
any errors that might indicate a problem.  Rerun the program with the
-u option when ready and the arrival table will be altered.  
In general, it would probably also be good practice to always copy the
arrival table before running this program in either mode to allow one
to back out the original picks if something goes wrong.  
.IP -v
Be more verbose about errors.
.IP -pf
Use alternate parameter file pffile.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.LP 
By default the program sets all deltim attributes in arrivals it computes
to a fixed constant defined by the parameter \fIarrival_deltim\fR.  
Set the boolean \fIset_deltim_in_arrival\fR to false to retain the deltim
of the original arrival table entry for each pick being changes.  
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
This is a relatively crude program that has not been extensively exercised.
Proceed with caution and make sure you always retain an original arrival 
table before running this program.  As noted in the description the algorithm
used to estimate each new arrival is an approximation whose validity has not 
been thoroughly investigated.
