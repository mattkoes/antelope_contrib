.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmk_dmc_files\fP is designed to create and track the updates a network 
operator makes to a dataless SEED volume, virtual network definition (VND).  
When changes were made and what they were is important 
for dynamic networks such as the USArray Transportable Array.  
.LP
This script generates either (1) a single station or combined network dataless 
SEED volume or (2) a virtual network definition file.  It allows for a comment on 
why the update was made to be tracked in an extension table, \fIdmcfiles\fP.
The output table can then be queried to retrieve the comment for products
such as webpages.  Of course, the results of such a query can only be as good 
as the comments that are entered.  The output \fIdmcfiles\fP extension table 
is also used by the \fBims2dmc\fP program.

\fBmk_dataless_seed\fP is called to generate the dataless volume.  \fBdeployment2vnd\fP
is called to generate a Virtual Network Definition file.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -v
Verbose output.  
.IP -z
Use gzip to compress the output dataless SEED volume.
.IP "-C "
Use a product directory underneath which \fIvnc_dir\fP, \fIsta_dataless_dir\fP or \fIdataless_dir\fP are created.  The 
default is to create the \fIvnd_dir\fP, \fIsta_dataless_dir\fP and \fIdataless_dir\fP in the current directory.
This is very useful when used in conjunction with the \fI-o\fP option.  With \fI-o\fP,
the file to be transferred is stored in the \fIproduct_dir/vnc_dir\fP \fIproduct_dir/dataless_sta\fP or
\fIproduct_dir/dataless_dir\fP area, but the file transferred via orbxfer appears as 
\fIvnd_dir/YYYY/VNET_YYYYMMMDD.csv/\fP on the remote server.  Ignored if -d is used.  The directory to be
used is specified in the \fImk_dmc_files.pf\fP parameter file.  Previous versions of this script made you
specify the directory on the command line for each run of the program.  See EXAMPLES.
.IP "-m "
Generate an automated email informing the \fImail_list\fP of an updated file.  The filename,
comment, and orb (if -o) are included in the text of the email.  The recipient list is specified in the
\fImk_dmc_files.pf\fP parameter file.  Previous versions of this script made you specify the recipients
on the command line for each run of the program.
.IP "-p parameter_file"
Parameter file to use.  The default parameter file name is \fBmk_dmc_files\fP.
.IP "-d output_dir"
Output directory for dataless SEED volume or vnd file.  This overrides the default
directory, \fIdataless_dir\fP , \fIsta_dataless_dir\fP, or \fIvnd_dir\fP, in the 
parameter file and no year or station directory is created.  Cannot use with -C.
.IP "-N net"
Network code to use in the output dataless SEED name.  This overrides the default
net code from the site.pf parameter file.  Irrelevant if -V option is selected.
.IP "-s sta"
Generate a dataless seed for this single station.  Single station dataless are stored 
in the \fIsta_dataless_dir\fP directory.  Irrelevant if -V option is selected.
.IP "-f filename"
Output dataless SEED or VND filename.  The default filename for a dataless SEED
volume is: \fIDATALESS.XX.YYYY.MM.DD\fP or \fIDATALESS.XX_STA.YYYY.MM.DD\fP where
\fIXX\fP is replaced with the value of \fI-N\fP, the default_seed_network from site.pf, 
or is left as \fIXX\fP if these other two values are undefined.  The default filename
for a VND is: \fIVNET_YYYYMMDD.csv\fP where VNET is replaced with the value given 
to -V.  If the -z option is used the output file name has .gz appended to it.  See 
BUGS AND CAVEATS below if using -z with the -o option.
.IP "-o orb"
Output orb for \fBorbxfer2\fP(1).  Files are placed into the \fBorbxfer2\fP server orb 
using the \fIvnd_dir\fP and \fIdataless_dir\fP from the pf file.  Because of this, 
you might not want to use a path containing the filesystem root.  Anyone on the receiving
side of \fBorbxfer2\fP that is attempting to write the files out using the same directory 
structure would have a long path to look down if a root level directory structure is used.
Note however that the absolute path is placed into the dir field in the output
dmcfiles table.  Look at the \fI-C\fP option if you have a long path to where the 
files are stored, but do not want to transfer that full path with orbxfer.  Also 
see BUGS AND CAVEATS below.
.IP "-V vnet"
Generate a Virtual Network Definition (VND) file using the specified virtual network
code.  These codes are created and maintained by the DMC.  Example vnets include: _US-TA, 
_US-EARN, _CASCADIA-TA, _US-BB, _OBSIP, _ANSS, etc.  See http://www.iris.edu/vnets.  
Either -V or -D must be specified on the command line.
.IP -D
Generate a dataless SEED volume rather than a VND file. Either -V or -D must be specified
on the command line.
.IP dbin
Input database from which the dataless or VND is generated.  See \fBmk_dataless_seed\fP(1) or
\fBdeployment2vnd\fP(1) for requirements.  This argument is required.
.IP dbtrack
Database where the tracking table, \fIdmcfiles\fP exists.  This may be different 
than \fIdbin\fP.  This argument is required. 
.IP comment
A descriptive comment that describes what prompted you to make a new 
dataless SEED volume or changes to the VND.  The maximum string length is 180 characters.  The 
parameter file has a very generic default comment if you do not specify one
on the command line.  You might consider attempting to use consistent comments for ease in
use of subsetting for web page or other scripts that interact with the \fIdmcfiles\fP 
table.  The maximum comment length is 180 characters.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Need to have sourced $ANTELOPE/setup.csh and environment variable
$PFPATH set.

This is a very basic parameter file that specifies default output 
directories and a basic comment.

.IP \fIvnc_dir\fP
Output directory where VND files are saved.  If using the \fBorbxfer2\fP
-o option, this is the base directory that the receiver catches
the files in.  Do not use a directory starting at the root level if
the files are going to be transferred with \fBorbxfer2\fP.  Use the -C option if
you wish to transfer files with orbxfer2 that will be received below the
\fIvnc_dir\fP, but reside under a different directory on your storage system.
.IP \fIdataless_dir\fP
Output directory where whole network dataless files are saved.
.IP \fIsta_dataless_dir\fP
Output directory where single station dataless files are saved.
.IP \fIproduct_dir\fP
Top level directory where product files are saved.  When the \fI-C\fP option is used, all
\fIdataless_dir\fP, \fIvnd_dir\fP, and \fIsta_dataless_dir\fP directories are created 
under \fIproduct_dir\fP.  The intent is that when the \fI-o\fP option is used, \fBorbxfer(1)\fP 
will not include this top level directory with the file transfer.
.IP \fImailto\fP
Comma separated list of email addresses which receive notification of updated files.
.IP \fIdefault_comment\fP
The default comment to be placed in the \fIdmcfiles\fP table.  The 
maximum length of this string is 180 characters.

.LP Generate a complete dataless for a network after adding two new stations.  
Store it in a data products directory on your raid system, but transfer using orbxfer2
with only the dataless_dir appearing for the receiver.

.LP In the above case the file generated would be something like
/raid/data/products/dataless/2008/DATALESS.TA.2008.03.25.   It would
appear in the anfexport:meta orb as a source that looked like:
.in 2c
.ft CW
.nf
   anfhost/xfer/76596/DATALESS.TA.2008.03.25
.fi
.ft R

.LP If a downstream user was connected to the anfexport:meta
orb with orbxfer2 in the receiver mode and chose to have the
directories preserverd, they would receive the file on their
host as:

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
Errors from the system calls to \fBmk_dataless_seed(1)\fP or \fBdeployment2vnd(1)\fP are 
not trapped properly by the elog routines.
.LP
Make sure your input database has no egregious errors.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP
Earlier versions (prior to 5.1-64) required arguments after the \fI-m\fP and \fI-C\fP
options.  Those arguments have been pushed into the parameter file.
.LP
This is an in-house script necessary for the functionality of the USArray 
Transportable array.  Please let me know if you find it useful, or seriously
lacking in features that might help your group's needs.
.LP
If there is no reader attached to the specified output orb with -o, the program 
hangs until a reader is attached.  To avoid this behavior, the \fIwait_match\fP
parameter in the orbxfer2.pf file must be blank.
.LP
The 4.9 and earlier versions of orbxfer2 had a bug such that compressed files
pushed into the orb would retain there file names (i.e. \fImyfile.gz\fP), but would 
actually be uncompressed before placement in the orb.  The receiver would then
get \fImyfile.gz\fP out of the orb, but it would be an uncompressed file.  I believe 
this bug has been resolved. 
.LP
If there are permissions problems with the output orb used with -o, the transfer
of the file to the orb may fail silently.  Review the orbserver logs to see if
there is a problem.
.LP
All of the different directory options are confusing.  I included them rather
than choosing a single method that I commonly use.  I would be interested to 
hear of other ways people might use this program and modifications that might
be required or clarifications that you would find helpful.
.LP
See the current SEED manual for a full description of a dataless SEED volume.
.LP
Converse with the DMC regarding the format of the VND files.
