.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBq330_location\fP extracts q330 /pf/st files from an orb, finds the current lat and long 
provided by the gps clock at each station, and compares the values to those in the 
site and dlsite table.  
A second ORB capable of accepting dlcmd instructions can be specified at run time. Otherwise, 
dlcmd will go to \fIstatus_orb\fP.
